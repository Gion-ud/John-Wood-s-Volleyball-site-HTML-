        <h1>Volleyball</h1>
        <p>Volleyball is a dynamic and engaging team sport played by millions of people around the world. It involves two
            teams, usually of six players each, trying to score points by sending a ball over a net and grounding it on the
            opponent’s court. The sport emphasizes agility, teamwork, and strategy, and is known for its fast-paced and
            exciting rallies.</p>   
    </div>
    <p>Invented in 1895 by William G. Morgan in Massachusetts, USA, volleyball has evolved into both a recreational
        pastime and a professional, competitive sport. Today, volleyball is played in many forms, including indoor,
        beach, sitting (for para-athletes), and even snow volleyball in some parts of the world.</p>
